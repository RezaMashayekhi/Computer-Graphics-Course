# Computer-Graphics-Course

Assignments of the Introduction to Computer Graphics that I had at UofA 2021.

The course assignments were implemented in JavaScript, WebGL, and HTML.

As for the fifth assignment, the code base was given to us and we had to extend it to create below objects using Ray Tracing.
